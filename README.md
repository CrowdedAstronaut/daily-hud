# About the Project <a name="about"></a>

daily-HUD is a fully rendered, interactive, mobile first app that allows users to learn more about the weather, details about different cryptocurrencies, and the current state of the fear-and-greed index. I prioritized semantic naming conventions, hierarchies and aria-labels to ensure daily-HUD works well with assistive technologies (ie screen readers).
